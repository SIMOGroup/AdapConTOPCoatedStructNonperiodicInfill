# Introduction
We developed an open source for a direct multiscale topology optimization method for additive manufacturing (AM) of coated structures with nonperiodic infill by employing an adaptive mapping technique of adaptive geometric components (AGCs). The AGCs consist of a framework of macro-sandwich bars that represent the macrostructure with the solid coating and a network of micro-solid bars that represent the nonperiodic infill at the microstructural scale. 3D prototypes can be made by 3D printed machine after smoothing technique is solved.  

Structure of AdapConTOPCoatedStructNonperiodicInfill package: 
1. MainProgram: main program for running topology optimization problems. 
2. Other functions are given in subfolders. 
3. How to run AdapConTOPCoatedStructNonperiodicInfill 
  - Define a new problem following code structures 
  - Run MainProgram.m 
  - Get output
  - Call program for smoothing boundaries of final design to print out 3D prototypes
