# Introduction
We in this work developed a direct multiscale topology optimization method for additive manufacturing (AM) of coated structures with nonperiodic infill 
by employing an adaptive mapping technique of adaptive geometric components 
Structure of AdapConTOPCoatedStructNonperiodicInfill package: 
1. MainProgram: main program for running topology optimization problems. 
2. Other functions are given in subfolders. 
3. How to run AdapConTOPCoatedStructNonperiodicInfill 
  - Define a new problem following code structures 
  - Run MainProgram.m 
  - Get output
  - Call program for smoothing boundaries of final design to print out 3D prototypes
